# Faster-Fire-Red
A Patch for Fire Red (Rev 1) that adds quality of life improves for playing IronMON

* You must talk to Mom to start your adventure, but don't worry, she has something to show you
* The Oak Parcel quest is shortened by having the Mart Employee and Oak meet you part way
* Repel's will prompt you to use another one when your current one wears off
* TM's are Gold instead of Red
* Instant PC (very short animation for healing at the PokeCenter)
* Step Items in the Underground Pass and Sevii Islands are now guaranteed to spawn. This does not work with the Mt. Moon items.
* The PC Item is now in the lab instead of in the PC, allowing people to savestate in the lab and still have the PC item
* Bill no longer asks you to go to Sevii after beating Blaine
